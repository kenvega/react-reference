what is memoization

  process of remembering previous results computations to be reused in the future

  e.g. 20 * 42 = 840 -> save this result so we don't calculate it again later when asked again

what should not be memoized?

  - cheap functions that don't require a lot of computation
  - functions that don't always return the same results given the same inputs (non-deterministic functions)
  - side effects because they still have to be done again regardless of the previous result
  - time dependent functions

  after that you should probably just have pure functions which will return the same output given the same input

the pseudocode for memoization

  - Receive the input

  - Check if this input has been seen before

  - If it was: return the result

  - If it wasn't: compute the result, store it along with the input. Return the result.
