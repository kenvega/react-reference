what is memoization

  process of remembering previous results computations to be reused in the future

  e.g. 20 * 42 = 840 -> save this result so we don't calculate it again later when asked again

what should not be memoized?

  - cheap functions that don't require a lot of computation
  - functions that don't always return the same results given the same inputs (non-deterministic functions)
  - time dependent functions
