If you give React the same element you gave it on the last render, it won't need to re-render it.

When a state changes in your component, it will re-render it.

But if your component have other child components that are static and don't change because of part of your state
  then you can extract that part and avoid re-render it

  If you can create an object prop for a component and make sure it doesn't change
    React won't need to re-run that component
