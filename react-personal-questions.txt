what is the difference between

  defining a variable inside/outside the scope of a component?
    does it make any performance/memory difference?
    is the variable accessible in other components?
    is it created more times in one and not other?

What does this warning mean?
  Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render`).
  Render methods should be a pure function of props and state.

  Also what caused it? and how to fix it?
