components
  - here only components that have been used more than in one page or module
  - usually don't belong to the design system (?) like a `SaveButton` (modified basic button)
  - if you have no system design, then all components used more than once should be here

pages
  - index will be imported here by the route file (?)
  - pages can have sections that won't be reused but is best to separate them (for order), in that case create sub folders (like hero)

assets
  - images and icons

utils
  - overly complicated functions here like formatting/transforming dates.
  - heavy functions in general
  - you can have also a file here related only for date functions
