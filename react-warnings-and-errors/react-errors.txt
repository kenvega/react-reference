This document tries to respond to these questions for errors I have seen when working with React.
  how to reproduce the error?
  what caused it in my case?
  how to fix it for my case?


ERROR in   Error: Child compilation failed:
  Module.createRequire is not a function
  ...
  1 ERROR in child compilations (Use 'stats.children: true' resp. '--stats-children' for more details)

  solution:
    this was an error showing up when starting the create-react-app with npm start

    forgot to use the correct node version

    fixed it by using correct version with node. probably this helps: https://medium.com/@kinduff/automatic-version-switch-for-nvm-ff9e00ae67f3
