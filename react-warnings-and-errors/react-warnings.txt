This document tries to respond to these questions for warnings I have seen when working with React.
  what is the warning text I have seen?
  what caused it in my case?
  how to fix it for my case?


Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render`).
  Render methods should be a pure function of props and state.


Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.
  This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.
  To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
