how to fetch data with hooks
  you would normally fetch data inside a useEffect with an empty dependency array

how to handle errors and loading state with hooks
  you can use the hook useState to set the error and loading states in the component

you can also create custom data fetching hooks
  create a function that use all related to the request. e.g
    - axios
    - useState to store the data in state, and also error and loading state
    - useEffect to trigger the fetching of the data
  
  then finally return an array like hooks do and fill it with the important data you need
