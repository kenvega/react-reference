Where to fetch in your React app when you have a complex component tree?

  Things to consider which component should fetch the data

    fetch data on the common parent of the components that are interested on the fetched data

    also where you need to show a conditional load indicator when you are fetching the data
      the most common parent to the components interested in the data could be also the one that shows the loading

      but if you need to show it on a more top level component, then you should fetch the data there

    the same happens for where you need to show an error message when the fetching fails

How to fetch data in React?

  in component based react

    you most likely fetch in componentDidMount() then render a loading spinner while is fetching

    when is done the state gets updated with setState()
      and once that happens the render() method runs again with the data fetched
      here the loading state also goes from false to true
      and the error state gets filled if there was an error with the request

What about loading spinner and error handling?

  you can then render conditionally the data or the error if there was any
