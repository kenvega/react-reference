if you have logic and view components

  and you have a state that is only going to be used and changed in the view component
  then is it better to still create it and pass it to the view component?
  or is it better to only create it in the view component?

  an experienced friend told me it's better to create state at the nearest level where it's going to be used
    so in this case, even with the names logic and view, it would be better to create that state in the view component
