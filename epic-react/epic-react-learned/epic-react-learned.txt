  how do you manage DOM nodes using javascript?
    normally you might need to use these or more functions

      createElement
      getElementById
      setAttribute
      append

    example

      <body>
        <script type="module">
          // setting root div
          const rootElement = document.createElement('div')
          rootElement.setAttribute('id', 'root')
          document.body.append(rootElement)

          // appending hello world to root div
          const div = document.createElement('div')
          div.textContent = 'Hello world'
          div.className = 'container'
          rootElement.append(div)
        </script>
      </body>

  how do you create and render elements with the raw React API?

    you will need to use these methods
      React.createElement
      ReactDOM.render

    these methods need the library react and react-dom

    example of a nested structure created with raw React API

      const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

      const span1 = React.createElement('span', {children: 'Hello'})
      const span2 = React.createElement('span', {children: 'World'})

      const containerElement = React.createElement('div', {
        className: 'container',
        children: [span1, span2], // children can be a single primitive value or an array
      })

      ReactDOM.render(containerElement, rootElement)

  what does createElement returns in pure javascript?

    it returns an object that you can log the console

      some of their properties are
        $$typeof - to indicate that is in fact a react element
        key
        props - the second argument object that you pass to createElement
        ref
        type - the type of the html element that will be rendered. e.g. div

  is there a difference between creating elements with jsx and the raw react api?

    it seems it doesn't
      this code creates a react element with its raw api
        const element = React.createElement('div', {
          className: 'container',
          children: 'Hello World',
        })

      this code creates a react element with jsx
        const element = <div className="container">Hello World</div>

      both can be rendered to the page with the render method
        ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'))

      you could console.log both elements and will get an object with the same properties

  what does babel does when imported as a script?

    it will search for any script tags with type="text/babel" and it will compile it
      javascript actually won't do anything to those script types

    babel can for example compile your jsx code to javascript code that uses the raw React API
      e.g.
        const ui = <h1 id="greeting">Hey there</h1>

      gets transformed to
        const ui = React.createElement('h1', {id: 'greeting', children: 'Hey there'})

    you can tests more examples here: https://babeljs.io/repl

    you can import babel in your html file and use it to transpile your code directly in your browser
      but this should only be for testing and not for production
      for production you pre compile your code and then send the compiled version to the browser

  jsx

    can be converted by babel to regular javascript

    it's an alternative to create your react elements without using the raw React API

    it is similar to html but also it lets you use javascript at the same time

    because it uses javascript keywords there are some element tags that have some specific changes

      - the class for a tag cannot be named class. instead use className

      - the for attribute on a label is renamed to htmlFor

      - more differences can be found at: https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes

    you can also interpolate javascript variables into your tags

    if you use the in browser babel version to test (imported script tag in your html file)
      you can inspect your browser and find the compiled version from your jsx code to a regular javascript code
        this compiled version was made by babel and it is what the browser actually understands

    you can create a react element with jsx, assign it to a javascript variable and log it
      and you will get the exact same object you get when creating that object with the raw React API

  so in summary until now, to make react work
    you need React library to create react elements
    you need react-dom to put those react elements to the page
    and you need babel to create them with jsx instead of the raw React API
